# 🚀 Why Use React?

React is a **JavaScript library** for building **user interfaces**, especially for **single-page applications (SPAs)**. It helps you build **reusable UI components** and manage your app's state efficiently.

---

## ✅ Pros of React

* **Component-based**: Build UI in small, reusable parts (components).
* **Virtual DOM**: Fast updates to the UI without reloading the page.
* **One-way data flow**: Easier to debug and manage.
* **Huge ecosystem**: Lots of libraries, tools, and community support.
* **Learn once, use anywhere**: Can be used in web, mobile (React Native), or even VR apps.

---

## ❌ Cons of React

* **JSX learning curve**: Mixing HTML with JS may feel weird at first.
* **Just a library**: Doesn’t provide everything (like routing, state management) out of the box.
* **Frequent updates**: Can sometimes feel overwhelming to keep up with changes.

## 🛠️ Ways to Start a React Project

### 1. **Vite (Recommended for Beginners & Speed)**

* Very fast setup and dev experience
* Example:

  ```bash
  npm create vite@latest my-app --template react
  cd my-app
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

### 2. **Create React App (CRA)**

* Classic way, but now slower and less recommended
* Example:

  ```bash
  npx create-react-app my-app
  cd my-app
  npm start
  ```

### 3. **Next.js (React + SSR + Routing + API)**

* Great for full-stack apps and SEO
* Comes with routing, SSR, static generation
* Example:

  ```bash
  npx create-next-app@latest
  cd my-app
  npm run dev
  ```

---

## ✨ Bonus Tip

You can write React components using **TypeScript** too, for better code safety:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-app --template react-ts
```

# 📘 Chapter 1: Initial Structure - Getting Started with React and Vite

In this chapter, we will explore how to create a new React project using **Vite** and understand the basic structure and tools that come with it. This will give you a solid foundation before diving into React development.

---

## 🚀 Project Setup with Vite

### 🛠️ Create a React Project
Use the following command in your terminal to create a new React + JavaScript project:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
cd my-react-app
npm install
```

> 📝 `npm create vite@latest` uses the latest version of Vite's project scaffolding tool.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure Explained

After setup, your project will look like this:

```
my-react-app/
├── node_modules/
├── public/
│   └── vite.svg
├── src/
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── index.css
│   └── main.jsx
├── .gitignore
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── vite.config.js
└── README.md
```

### Key Files and Folders:

| File/Folder      | Description                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `node_modules/`  | Contains all installed dependencies. Never edit this manually.   |
| `public/`        | Static files that don’t go through bundling. e.g., logos, fonts. |
| `src/`           | Your main application code lives here.                           |
| `App.jsx`        | Your root component. Think of it as the "main UI block".         |
| `main.jsx`       | Entry point – React starts from here.                            |
| `index.html`     | The base HTML page where your app is injected.                   |
| `vite.config.js` | Configuration file for Vite – usually fine by default.           |
| `.gitignore`     | Tells Git which files/folders to ignore (like `node_modules`).   |
| `package.json`   | Lists your dependencies, scripts, and metadata.                  |

## 📦 What is NPM?

**NPM (Node Package Manager)** is a tool used to install, manage, and share JavaScript packages.

* You use it to install libraries like React.
* It reads and writes from the `package.json` file.
* Common commands:

  * `npm install` – Installs all dependencies.
  * `npm install <package>` – Installs a specific package.
  * `npm run dev` – Starts the Vite development server.

---

## 🌐 What is Node.js?

**Node.js** is a runtime that allows you to run JavaScript outside the browser. It enables:

* Running build tools like Vite.
* Using NPM for installing libraries.
* Running your development server locally.

---

## 📄 What is `.gitignore`?

`.gitignore` is a file that tells Git which files or folders **should not** be tracked by version control.

Example:

```
node_modules
dist
.env
```

Why?

* You don’t want to commit generated or sensitive files.
* Keeps your repo clean and lightweight.

---

## 📁 What is `node_modules/`?

This folder contains **all the packages** your project depends on.

* Automatically generated by `npm install`.
* **Should not** be edited or pushed to Git.
* Often very large — hence excluded via `.gitignore`.

---

## 📏 What is ESLint?

**ESLint** is a tool that helps you find and fix problems in your code automatically.

* It checks for bad practices, typos, or coding style issues.
* Improves code consistency and quality.
* Vite React template comes with basic ESLint pre-configured.

Common usage:

```bash
npx eslint src/
```

## 🎨 Setting up Tailwind CSS

### ✅ Step 1: Install Tailwind and dependencies

Run this in your terminal:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
```


### ✅ Step 2: Configure Tailwind

In `vite.config.js`, update the `plugins` property:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'
// https://vite.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(),  tailwindcss(),],
})

```

### ✅ Step 3: Add Tailwind to CSS

Replace `src/index.css` with:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

### ✅ Step 4: Use Tailwind in Your App

Now you can use Tailwind classes in your components:

```jsx
import { Link } from "react-router";

export const About = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Goto <Link to="/" className="text-blue-500">Home</Link>
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}
```
---

## 📝 Why tailwind ?
Simplifies styling and is useful for fast prototyping

Tailwind CSS:
<button class="bg-blue-500 text-white py-2 px-4 rounded">Login</button> 

Plain CSS:
```css
.custom-button {
  background-color: #3b82f6; /* Tailwind's bg-blue-500 */
  color: white;              /* Tailwind's text-white */
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;      /* Tailwind's py-2 px-4 */
  border-radius: 0.25rem;    /* Tailwind's rounded */
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

## Creating simple form 

### 🧩 1. **State for Email and Password**

```js
const [email, setEmail] = useState('')
const [password, setPassword] = useState('')
```

* These lines use `useState` to create **state variables**.
* `email` and `password` store the user's input.
* `setEmail` and `setPassword` are functions used to **update** those values when the user types in the input fields.

---

### 🧠 2. **Handling Form Submission**

```js
const handleSubmit = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault()
  console.log('form submitted', email, password)
}
```

* This function runs **when the form is submitted**.
* `event.preventDefault()` stops the browser from refreshing the page (which is the default behavior of a form).
* `console.log(...)` prints the current values of email and password to the console. In a real app, you might send this data to a server instead.

---

### 📋 3. **The JSX (UI Part)**

```jsx
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  <input
    type="email"
    name="email"
    placeholder="Email"
    onChange={(event) => setEmail(event.target.value)}
  />
  <input
    type="password"
    name="password"
    placeholder="Password"
    onChange={(event) => setPassword(event.target.value)}
  />
  <button type="submit">Login</button>
</form>
```

* `<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>`: This calls `handleSubmit` when the user presses the "Login" button.
* `<input type="email" ...>`: This field is for the user's email. Whenever the user types, `setEmail` updates the state.
* `<input type="password" ...>`: Same for the password field.
* `<button type="submit">`: When clicked, this **submits the form**.

---

### 🧱 4. **Rendering in the App**

```js
function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <LoginForm />
    </>
  );
}
```

* The `App` component includes and renders the `LoginForm`.
* You can now see the login form when you open your app in the browser.

---

### ✅ Summary

| Part                          | Purpose                                       |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `useState`                    | To store and track user input                 |
| `onChange`                    | To update state as the user types             |
| `onSubmit` + `preventDefault` | To handle form submission without page reload |
| `console.log(...)`            | To check entered values for now               |

This is a simple pattern you'll use often in React for forms and basic interactivity.



## 🧭 Understanding `e.preventDefault()`

When working with forms in React (or plain HTML/JavaScript), submitting a form by default causes the browser to **reload the page**. This is the standard HTML behavior.

To stop that from happening — especially when you're handling the form submission with JavaScript — you use:

```js
e.preventDefault();
```

### 📌 What it does:

* It **prevents** the browser’s default behavior (form submission + page reload).
* This allows you to handle the form data with JavaScript — for example, validating input or showing a success message — without refreshing the page.

### 🧠 Example in a form:

```jsx
const handleSubmit = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault(); // Stops the page from reloading

  // your form logic here
};
```
